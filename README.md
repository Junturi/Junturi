# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Riikka!
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, youâ€™ll find projects that reflect my transition from hospitality to the world of Information Technology.

## ðŸŒŸ About Me
- ðŸ’¼ **Background:** I bring over 10 years of experience in the hospitality industry, with roles across luxury hotels, conference venues, and family-friendly resorts. My experience has given me a unique perspective on user needs and problem-solving.
- ðŸŽ“ **Current Pursuit:** Iâ€™m currently studying for my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology, focusing on embedded systems.
- ðŸ’¡ **Passion:** Iâ€™m excited to bring together my customer-oriented background with technical solutions that drive real-world impact, bridging the gap between user needs and innovative technology.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Skills

- **Microcontrollers & Hardware:** nRF5340, Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi
- **Programming:** C/C++, Python, SQL
- **Machine Learning:** K-means clustering, Keras, Tensorflow
- **Tools & Platforms:** VS Code, PyCharm, Google Colab, MySQL
- **Interests:** Embedded Systems, IoT, Machine Learning

## ðŸš€ Project Spotlight: Direction Detection and Data Logging System

As part of my studies, Iâ€™m currently working on an IoT project involving:

- **nRF5340:** We use this microcontroller for signal processing and computation.
- **Accelerometer:** Captures multi-directional movement data.
- **K-means Model on nRF5340:** To classify the accelerometerâ€™s direction data, we implemented a K-means clustering algorithm directly on the nRF5340, allowing for efficient, on-device computation.
- **Raspberry Pi:** Serves as an intermediary, collecting data from the nRF5340 and transmitting it to a web server.
- **Linux Web Server:** Receives data from the Raspberry Pi and stores it in a database for analysis and retrieval.

> **Note:** This project is currently housed in a private repository as itâ€™s part of my coursework and will be graded. I look forward to making it publicly available upon completion!

ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Currently Exploring

- Optimizing machine learning models for embedded systems.
- Integrating low-power wireless communication for efficient data transmission.
- Expanding my knowledge of real-time data processing and IoT system architecture.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
